Running the application:

(note: you'll need MongoDB and Node.js installed)

1. Run an instance of MongoDB on the default port
2. Run server.js (from this directory 'node server.js')
3. Import the .sql file into APEX
4. Go to 'shared components'
5. Go to 'web references'
6. Change the IP address for each web reference to the IP address of the 
   machine the server is running on, but leave everything from the port number
   onward
7. That should be all!
