Running the application:

(note: you'll need MongoDB and Node.js installed)

1. Run an instance of MongoDB on the default port
2. Run server.js (from this directory 'node server.js')
3. Import the .sql file into APEX
4. Go to 'shared components'
5. Go to 'web references'
6. Change the IP address for each web reference to the IP address of the 
   machine the server is running on, but leave everything from the port number
   onward
7. Pages 14, 15, and 16 have a process that fires in the prerendering phase
   'before header'. Change the IP addresses found in these processes to the
   IP address of the machine the server is running on. Do the same for page 18,
   the only difference is that the page 18 process fires 'before regions'
8. That should be all!
